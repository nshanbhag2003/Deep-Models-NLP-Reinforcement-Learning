# From Text to Control: Deep Learning for Prediction and Decision-Making
This repository combines supervised and reinforcement learning to demonstrate how neural networks can both understand data and make decisions. It includes: 

(1) CNN and Bag-of-Words models for IMDB sentiment classification and
(2) Deep Q-Network for solving the CartPole control task. 

Together, these illustrate how deep learning supports prediction and sequential decision-making in various domains.
